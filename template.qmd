## Background

{{< lipsum 2p >}}

## Identification Strategy

Our identification strategy builds upon the framework established by prior research. We utilize a difference-in-differences approach to isolate the causal effect of our treatment variable on the outcome of interest. By comparing changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group, we aim to control for unobserved confounders that may bias our estimates.

Let $Y_{it}$ denote the outcome variable for unit $i$ at time $t$, and let $D_{it}$ be a binary treatment indicator that equals 1 if unit $i$ is treated at time $t$ and 0 otherwise. We also include a vector of control variables $X_{it}$ to account for observable characteristics that may influence the outcome. The model can be specified as follows:

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta D_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \delta_t + \mu_i + \epsilon_{it}
$${#eq-diff-in-diff}

where $\delta_t$ represents time fixed effects, $\mu_i$ captures unit fixed effects, and $\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term. The coefficient of interest, $\beta$, measures the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).

To ensure the validity of our identification strategy, we conduct several robustness checks. First, we test for parallel trends in the pre-treatment period to confirm that the treatment and control groups were on similar trajectories before the intervention. Second, we implement placebo tests by assigning fake treatment dates to verify that our results are not driven by random chance. Additionally, we explore alternative specifications of the model, including varying the set of control variables and using different functional forms.

By employing this identification strategy, we aim to provide credible estimates of the causal impact of our treatment variable on the outcome of interest, contributing to the broader literature on this topic.
